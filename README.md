# Policy Ops

Policy Ops is a React component library that provides a simple way to integrate policy agreements into your React applications. It is designed to help developers easily manage and display policy agreements, track user consent, and store agreement evidence.

## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, legal compliance is more critical than ever, particularly concerning user agreements for service policies such as terms of use, privacy policies, and security policies. Regulatory requirements and user trust hinge on a companyâ€™s ability to maintain accurate records of user agreements, especially when policy updates necessitate explicit user consent.

However, managing these legal processes can be cumbersome for legal teams and developers alike. Legal teams often struggle to efficiently manage policy versions and track user consent, while developers are burdened with integrating these changes into their applications, often requiring additional database configurations to persist user agreements.

### Key Features

The Legal Opt-in project will include the following key features:

1. **Policy Versioning:** The system will maintain a history of policy versions and user agreements, ensuring that the company is always audit-ready and compliant with regulatory standards.
2. **User Agreement Component:** A reusable React component that developers can easily integrate into their projects. This component will handle the display of policy agreements, user consent tracking, and storage of agreement evidence.

### Tech Stack

The Legal Opt-in project will be built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React for building the user interface and components.
- **Backend:** Next.js for server-side logic and API.

Alright... Let's get started! ðŸš€

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
npm install --save @apcandsons/pops-react
```

## Usage

### Policy Component

The Policy component is used to display the policy to the user
and to allow the user to agree to the policy.

```jsx title="pages/policies/terms-of-use.jsx"
import React from 'react';
import { Policy } from '@apcandsons/pops-react';

export default function TermsOfUse() {
    return (
        <Policy
            serviceId="cm0plu1gk0001148XXXXX"
            policyKey="terms-of-use"
        />
    )
}
```

Where:
* `serviceId` is the unique identifier for the Legal Opt-in API.

### Opt-in Component

Generally, the Legal Opt-in component can be placed on the
near-top level of your application to ensure that it is always
visible to the user.

However, it order to ensure that user information is provided
to determine if the user has already agreed to the terms,
the Legal Opt-in component should be placed within a context
that provides the user information.

```jsx title="_app.jsx"
import React from 'react';
import { OptInProvider } from '@apcandsons/pops-react';

function AppContent({ pageProps, Component }) {
    const currentAccount = useCurrentAccount()
    return (
        <div>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
            <OptInProvider
                serviceId="cm0plu1gk0001148XXXXX"
                userId={currentAccount.email}
                userProperties={{
                    role: currentAccount.role,
                    orgId: currentAccount.organizationId,
                }}
            />
        </div>
    )
}

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
    return (
        <SomeOtherProvider>
            <AppContent Component={Component} pageProps={pageProps} />
        </SomeOtherProvider>
    )
}
```

Where
* `serviceId` is the unique identifier for the Legal Opt-in API.
* `userId` is the unique identifier for the user.
* `userProperties` is an arbitrary additional information about the user.
    * Keys that appea in this object need to be defined in the Legal Opt-in API, otherwise, they'll be rejected.
* `apiBaseUrl` is the base URL for the Legal Opt-in API. By default it would connect to the cloud hosted version (Optional)
